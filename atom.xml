    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been really enjoying my experience at fullstack.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been both fun and challenging.</p>

<p>I think my favorite part of a bunch of great parts was learning how to do mass-mailing and texting were great real-world applications using what we have already gone through.</p>

<p>The second half of the first 11 testfirsts were out of my league, but having David go through the thought process out loud (reading through the rspec and then writing the code) was very helpful.  I plan on following the suggestion to do all of the testfirsts over again this weekend.</p>

<p>I did not like the idea of paired learning at first, but it worked out really well.  I may have been able to write the code faster alone, but I am sure that I learned much more in a pair (or trio in my case) because I had to get back into teacher mode to explain my ideas.  Sometimes talking it out made the idea make more sense to myself, and other times it made me realize that I was completely wrong.  My teammates also gave me tips and ideas I would not have been able to come up with on my own.</p>

<p>It seems like so much has happened even though only a week has passed.  I look forward to more.  I am actually happier than I have been in a long time, and it has been noticeable to my friends and family.</p>

<h1>Alternate Header 1</h1>

<h2>Alternate Header 2</h2>

<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>

<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>

<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>

<ol>
<li>First ordered list item</li>
<li>Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.</li>
<li>Actual numbers don&rsquo;t matter, just that it&rsquo;s a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list</li>
<li>And another item.</li>
</ol>


<p>⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&rsquo;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).</p>

<p>⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li>
<li>Or minuses</li>
<li>Or pluses</li>
</ul>
